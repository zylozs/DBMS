- take in R
- take in FDs
- choose normal form

3NF
- calculate closure
	- extract keys
	- extract FDs
- calculate set of primes
- reduce given fds to minimal basis
	- Reduce keys that have more than 1 attribute on right
	- Find redundant keys and remove them
- Create tables on revised FDs
- Eliminate subsets
	- compare tables with each other to determine if they are subsets
	- remove them if they are
- check to see if any of the tables is a key
	- if no key, add a key as a new table
	- if key is found, we are done
	
Chase Test
- Create table/chart/thing from tables given from 3NF
	- Enter the attributes each table has into the chart
	- Fill in blanks with numbered letters based off index
- Iterate through given FDs (can use either minimal or non minimal ones, it will work either way)
	- perform modification based off the FD
- Search table for a row that has all the original attributes for R
- If this is found, it was decomposed properly, otherwise we screwed up 3NF!
